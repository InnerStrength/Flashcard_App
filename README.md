Flashcard App for Language Development

Flips cards back and forth, check to see if you got the word right or wrong with a relatively non-hideous User Interface. Closeing the app saves missed cards for later review, or you can review missed items during your session. 

May add additional languages at a later date. Capstone project for Tkinter, Pandas, and CSV import export.
